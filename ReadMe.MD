# Data Structures Learning Repository

## Overview

This repository is a collection of data structures implemented in C++. It serves as a learning resource for understanding the fundamentals of data structures and their implementations in C++.

## Introduction

This repository contains various data structures, each implemented in C++. The goal is to provide clear and concise examples for educational purposes. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, these implementations aim to be both informative and accessible.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure that you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/))
- Code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivoo29/Trying_DataStructure
   cd data-structures-learning
   ```

2. **Choose a Data Structure:**
   Navigate to the specific data structure you want to explore. Each data structure is in its own directory.

3. **Compile and Run:**
   Use your C++ compiler to compile the source code. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

4. **Explore and Learn:**
   Take a look at the code, comments, and any provided explanations to understand the implementation. Feel free to experiment with the code and modify it for better understanding.
